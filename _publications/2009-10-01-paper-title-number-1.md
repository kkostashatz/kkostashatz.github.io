This paper investigates optimal execution strategies in intraday energy markets through a **bivariate Hawkes process** with transient price impact. Calibrated to German intraday electricity data, the model reproduces:

* pronounced intra-session volatility,  
* characteristic intraday activity patterns, and  
* the **Samuelson effect** as gate closure approaches.

By coupling the Hawkes-driven order-flow with a transient impact kernel, we derive an optimal trading schedule for large-volume market participants. Back-tests show substantial cost savings versus **TWAP** and **VWAP** benchmarks across multiple hourly products.
